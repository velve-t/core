> The author of this project is living proof that if you exist under a beautifully fascist oppressive regime long enough, you inevitably become everything they warn people about. A model citizen? Absolutely not. Anti-government? Check. Anti-social? Double-check. Anti-dictatorship? Triple-check and counting. His general demeanor resembles that of an escaped lunatic, but let’s not rush to judgments, perhaps this is just the natural side effect of watching his homeland spiral into a bureaucratic circus. While others embrace blind patriotism, he’s out here sketching plans for an exit route, fueled by frustration, existential dread, and the sheer audacity to question authority. Nationalistic loyalty? Not on his agenda. In fact, he’s so detached from the notion of "*belonging*" that if passports had a "*None of the Above*" checkbox, he’d be the first to tick it. At the end of the day, this project is less about AI and more about documenting what happens when someone realizes that home is just a concept, and escaping, __is the only logical conclusion__
