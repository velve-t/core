### So what is this?
> It's a chatbot, but related to history alike ! ü§ó

### What is that supposed to mean?
Velvet is a specialized chatbot designed to deliver precise, structured responses to inquiries about historical events, figures, and contexts. While I, as the author, acknowledge that it is __not yet perfect__, this project serves as a testament to the potential of artificial intelligence when leveraged responsibly. I believe that through thoughtful and ethical AI development, we can create innovative and meaningful solutions that inspire creativity and discovery

### Why am I doing this?
I‚Äôve always liked the idea of a multidisciplinary approach to education. it keeps things interesting. Research is fun too, though my focus might be a bit different from what a humanities grad would typically do, like analyzing artifacts or archival sites. This project, though, is something bigger. Again, It‚Äôs my way of showing how AI, when used thoughtfully, can unlock creative and meaningful discoveries. Maybe it‚Äôs not perfect yet, but hey, that‚Äôs part of the journey

### What tools and plugins did you use while creating this project?
1. Any kind of *Virtual* IDE: Primarily used <a href="https://gitpod.io/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-gitpod-orange?logo=gitpod&logoColor=white&label=" alt="gitpod" /></a> for a cloud-based development environment.

2. Runtime: Leveraged <a href="https://bun.sh/">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/bun-%23000000.svg?logo=bun&logoColor=white" alt="bun"></a> for its performance and modern <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-%23F7DF1E.svg?logo=javascript&logoColor=white" alt="js"></a> runtime capabilities.

3. Framework: Built the project using <a href="https://nextjs.org/">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/next.js-%23000000.svg?logo=next.js&logoColor=white" alt="next"></a> for its robust features and [server-side rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering).

4. Styling: Implemented <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwind.css-%2338B2AC.svg?logo=tailwindcss&logoColor=white" alt="Tailwind CSS"></a> for utility-first styling.
   
5. Component Library: Used <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/shadcn/ui-%2318181B.svg?logo=vercel&logoColor=white" alt="shadcn/ui"></a> to streamline ui development.

6. Language: Mostly in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-%23007ACC.svg?logo=typescript&logoColor=white" alt="TypeScript"></a> for type safety and maintainability.

7. API Keys & LLM Backend: Integrating [DeepSeek](https://console.groq.com/docs/model/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) LLM as the primary language model, utilizing <a href="https://console.groq.com/home"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Groq-%23F55036.svg" alt="Groq"></a> as the inference provider for optimized performance. 

8. Backend Services: Implementing <a href="https://dashboard.clerk.com/apps"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Clerk-%23000000.svg?logo=clerk&logoColor=purple" alt="Groq"></a> for authentication and account management, while <a href="https://supabase.com/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Supabase-%2300E676.svg?logo=supabase&logoColor=white" alt="Supabase"></a> handles chat history storage and retrieval
